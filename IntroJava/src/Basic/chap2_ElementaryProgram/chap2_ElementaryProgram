2.4 Identifiers
Identifiers are the names that identify the elements such as classes, methods, and
variables in a program

2.5 Variables
Variables are used to represent values that may be changed in the program

2.6 Assignment Statements and Assignment
Expressions
An assignment statement designates a value for a variable. An assignment statement
can be used as an expression in Java

2.7 Named Constants
A named constant is an identifier that represents a permanent value

2.8 Naming Conventions
Sticking with the Java naming conventions makes your programs easy to read and
avoids errors

2.9 Numeric Data Types and Operations
Java has six numeric types for integers and floating-point numbers with operators +,
-, *, /, and %

2.10 Numeric Literals
A literal is a constant value that appears directly in a program

2.11 Evaluating Expressions and Operator Precedence
Java expressions are evaluated in the same way as arithmetic expressions

2.12 Case Study: Displaying the Current Time
You can invoke System.currentTimeMillis() to return the current time

2.13 Augmented Assignment Operators
The operators +, -, *, /, and % can be combined with the assignment operator to form
augmented operators

2.14 Increment and Decrement Operators
The increment operator (++) and decrement operator (––) are for incrementing and
decrementing a variable by 1

2.15 Numeric Type Conversions
Floating-point numbers can be converted into integers using explicit casting

2.16 Software Development Process
The software development life cycle is a multistage process that includes requirements
specification, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance

2.17 Case Study: Counting Monetary Units
This section presents a program that breaks a large amount of money into smaller
units

2.18 Common Errors and Pitfalls
Common elementary programming errors often involve undeclared variables, uninitialized variables, integer overflow, unintended integer division, and round-off errors
