5.1 Introduction
A loop can be used to tell a program to execute statements repeatedly

5.2 The while Loop
A while loop executes statements repeatedly while the condition is true

while (loop-continuation-condition) {
// Loop body
Statement(s);
}


5.2.2 Loop Design Strategies
Step 1: Identify the statements that need to be repeated.
Step 2: Wrap these statements in a loop like this:
while (true) {
Statements;
}
Step 3: Code the loop-continuation-condition and add appropriate statements for
controlling the loop.
while (loop-continuation-condition) {
Statements;
Additional statements for controlling the loop;
}


5.4 : the For loop

for ( ; ; ) {
    //do something
}

=

for ( ; true; ) {
//do something
}

=

while (true) {
//do something
} => this is best
